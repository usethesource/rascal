question Replace the text box by the result of the multiplication and make the test true:
    expr multiplication $gen(int[2,7],A) * $gen(int[2,7],B)
end

question Replace the text box by the result of the intersection and make the test true:
    expr setIntersection $eval($gen(set[int]) + $gen(set[int],B)) & $eval($gen(set[int]) + $use(B))
end

question Replace the text box by a function name and make the test true:

question Create a function to print squares by placing all code fragments in the grey box in the right order with the right indentation:
movable
void squares(int n){
---------
  println("Squares from 1 to " + n);
---------
  for(int i <- [1 .. n + 1])
---------
    println(i + " squared = " + (i * i)); 
---------
}
end

question Create a function to print squares by placing all code fragments in the grey box in the right order with the right indentation (and avoid decoys!):
movable
void squares(int n){
---------
  println("Squares from 1 to " + n);
---------
  for(int i <- [1 .. n + 1])
---------
    println(i + " squared = " + (i * i)); 
---------
}
decoy
i = 0;
---------
i += 1;
---------
println(i + " squared = " + (i + i)); 
end

/**
 * Provides transparant access to the source code of the one and only standard library
 * that should be on the source path of the interpreter, which is contained in the same
 * jar as the current interpreter is from.
 * 
 * The std:/// scheme is mainly used by the interpreter, to load library modules; but it is also the location
 * of distributed sources of the standard library for use in the debugger. The references
 * that the type-checker produces for UI feature in the IDE also depend on this scheme.
 * 
 * This is accomplished by:
 * 1. rewriting all the references to the source locations of the library in 
 *   project://rascal/src/org/rascalmpl/library/...` to `std:///...`. This is done by the "packager"
 * 2. copying all the .rsc files of the library to the jar in the right location (mvn resources plugin)
 * 3. resolving std:/// to the same location inside of the jar
 * 4. **not** having more than one standard library in the classpath of the JVM, or more than one
 *    standard library in the libs path of a PathConfig.

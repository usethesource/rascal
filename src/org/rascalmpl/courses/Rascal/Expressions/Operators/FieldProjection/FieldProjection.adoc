# Field Projection
:concept: Expressions/Operators/FieldProjection

.Synopsis
Projection of tuple.

.Syntax
`_Exp_ < _Field_~1~, _Field_~2~ ... >`

.Types

.Function

.Description
_Exp_ should evaluate to a tuple or relation, and _Field_~i~ should be a field name or an integer constant
 that refers to elements in the order in which they occur in the original value (counting from 0). 

.Examples
Suppose we have a relation with traffic information that records the name of the day, the day number, and the length of the traffic jams at that day.
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>rel[str day, int daynum, int length] Traffic = 
>>>>>>>{<"mon", 1, 100>, <"tue", 2, 150>, <"wed", 3, 125>, 
>>>>>>> <"thur", 4, 110>, <"fri", 5, 90>};
rel[str,int,int]: {
  <"thur",4,110>,
  <"mon",1,100>,
  <"fri",5,90>,
  <"wed",3,125>,
  <"tue",2,150>
}
rascal>Traffic<length,daynum>;
rel[int,int]: {
  <150,2>,
  <110,4>,
  <100,1>,
  <125,3>,
  <90,5>
}
rascal>Traffic<2,day>;
rel[int,str]: {
  <110,"thur">,
  <125,"wed">,
  <90,"fri">,
  <100,"mon">,
  <150,"tue">
}
----
Field projection thus selects parts from a larger value that has a fixed number of parts. The selection is based on position and not on value and can be used to completely reorder or remove the parts of a larger value.

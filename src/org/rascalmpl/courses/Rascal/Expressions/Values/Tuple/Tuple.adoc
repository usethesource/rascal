.Description
A tuple is a sequence of elements with the following properties:

*  Each element in a tuple (may) have a different type.

*  Each element of a tuple may have a label that can be used to select that element of the tuple.

*  Each tuple is fixed-width, i.e., has the same number of elements.


Tuples are represented by the type `tuple[_T_~1~ _L_~1~, _T_~2~ _L_~2~, ...]`, 
where _T_~1~, _T_~2~, ... are arbitrary types and _L_~1~, _L_~2~, ... are optional labels. 

The following operators are provided for tuples:


.Examples
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>tuple[str first, str last, int age] P = <"Jo","Jones",35>;
tuple[str,str,int]: <"Jo","Jones",35>
rascal>P.first;
str: "Jo"
rascal>P.first = "Bo";
tuple[str,str,int]: <"Bo","Jones",35>

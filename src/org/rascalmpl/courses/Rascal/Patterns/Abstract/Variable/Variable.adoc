# Variable Pattern
:concept: Patterns/Abstract/Variable

.Synopsis
Variable in abstract pattern.

.Syntax
_Var_

.Types

.Function

.Description
A variable pattern can act in two roles:

* If _Var_ has already a defined value then it matches with that value.

*  If _Var_ has not been defined before (or it has been declared but not initialized) then it matches any value. 
    That value is assigned to _Var_. The scope of this variable is the outermost expression in which the pattern occurs
or the enclosing <<If>>, <<While>>, or <<Do>> if the pattern occurs in the test expression of those statements.

.Examples
Initialize variable `N`
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>N = 10;
int: 10
----
and use `N` in a pattern; its value is used as value to match with:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>N := 10;
ok
rascal>N := 20;
ok
----
Use a non-existing variable in a pattern, it is bound when the match succeeds:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>import IO;
ok
rascal>if(M := 10)
>>>>>>>   println("Match succeeded, M == <M>");
Match succeeded, M == 10
ok
----

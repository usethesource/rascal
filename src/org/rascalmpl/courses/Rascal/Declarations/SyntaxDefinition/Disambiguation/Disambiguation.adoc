.Synopsis

Disambiguation is the definition of filters on the parse trees that <<SyntaxD efinition>>s define. 
There are several ways of defining <<Disambiguation>> in Rascal.

.Description
There are generally three ways of removing ambiguity from parse forests that are produced by parsers generated from <<SyntaxDefinition>>s.

*  The first way is to add disambiguation declarations to the [SyntaxDefinition]. You can choose from:
   **  <<Priority Declaration>>s, which can be used to define the relative priority in expression languages
   **  <<Associativity Declaration>>s, which can be used to define relative associativity between operators of expression languages
   **  <<Follow Declaration>>s, which can be used to implement longest match using lookahead
   **  <<Precede Declaration>>s, which can be used to implement first match using look behind
   **  <<Reserve Declaration>s, which allow you to finite sets of strings from a [Syntax Definition] to implement keyword reservation
*  The second way is to add <<Action>>s that will be triggered just after parsing and allow you to trim a parse forest using any information necessary.
*  The third way is use the <<Visit>> statement on a parse tree and implement your own filter post-parsing time, or any other kind of program that processes [ParseTrees].

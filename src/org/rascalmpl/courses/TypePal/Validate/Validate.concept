# Validate a FRCModel

.Synopsis
The functions available during validation

.Description
Recall that requirements and calculators use function parameters of the respective types `void() predicates` and
`AType() calculator`. Although this are ordinary Rascal functions it is useful to summarize the TypePal-specific
functions that can be used inside these functions:

== typeof
The workhorse of TypePal is the function `typeof` that determines the type of given tree or source location.
When that is known, it is returned as value.
If it is not known, the internal exception `TypeUnavailable()` is thrown which will abort the execution of the
current requirement or calculator which will be tried later again.

[source,rascal]
----
AType typeof(Tree tree);
AType typeof(loc src);
AType typeof(str id, Key scope, set[IdRole] idRoles);
----
NOTE: Rascal has a builtin function `typeOf`; how can we avoid confusion with the above `typeof`?

== onError

Several of the available functions express their failure by way of an ErrorHandler defined as:

[source,rascal]
----
data ErrorHandler
    = onError(loc where, str msg)
    | noError()
    ;
   
ErrorHandler onError(Tree t, str msg);
----

For convenience, `onError` is available both for Tree and loc arguments;

== subtype
The function `subtype` determines whether `t1` is a subtype of `t2`.
Under the hood, the user-provided function `myIsSubType` is called.
When the outcome is true, `subtype` just returns, otherwise the error handler is invoked.

[source,rascal]
----
void subtype(AType t1, AType t2, ErrorHandler handler);
----

== lub
The function `lub` return the least upper bound of two types.
Under the hood, the user-provided function `myLUB` is called.
[source,rascal]
----
AType lub(AType t1, AType t2);
----

== unify
The function `unify` tries to unify two types.
When successful, this may lead to the binding of type variables occurring in these types.
When unsuccessful, the error handler is called.
[source,rascal]
----
void unify(AType t1, AType t2, ErrorHandler handler);
----
== instantiate
== reportError
== fmt

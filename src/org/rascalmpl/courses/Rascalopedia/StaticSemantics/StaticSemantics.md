.Description
The static semantics of a program describe all properties that can be determined before the program is executed.
A ((Typechecker)) is a tool that checks the properties of a program as described by its static semantics.

Static semantics describes properties that are relevant before a program is executed and 
differs from <<Dynamic Semantics>> that
describes the execution behaviour itself.

.Examples

Examples of static semantic properties include:

*  The proper use of types.
*  The proper use of names.


Language with substantial static semantics: Java, Haskell, Rascal.
Languages with only dynamic semantics: Python, Ruby.

#### Description

[Software engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) is the discipline that encompasses all aspects
of creating software and encompasses:

*  _Requirements engineering_: determine what the future owners and users of a software system expect.
*  _Software Design_: design the global architecture as well as as the technical details.
*  _Software Construction_: build software according to its specification.
*  _Software Testing_: test that software works according to its specifications.
*  _Software Deployment_: distribute software to its users.
*  _Software Maintenance_: maintain software after it has been deployed.


There are various models to organize the above activities. The classical [waterfall model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)
organizes them sequentially. Variations are more iterative and allow to go back to earlier phases.
Waterfall-based methods follow solid engineering practices but may lead to much bureacracy and an inflexible process that
cannot easily cope with changing requirements.

Other approaches promote [agile development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
and are characterized by very short iterations that include all the above activities.
Agile methods aim to produce prototypes as early as possible and this makes it easier for future users
to assess the prototype and suggest changes.

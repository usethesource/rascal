[Meir M. Lehman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_M._Lehman) was one of the first scientist to observe
that software evolves over its lifetime. He formulated several [laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman's_laws_of_software_evolution)
about software evolution. Here are three examples of his laws (slightly paraphrased):

*  _Continuing Change_: Programs must be continually adapted or they become progressively less usefull.
*  _Increasing Complexity_: When a program evolves, its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it.
*  _Continuing Growth_: The functional content of programs must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction over their lifetime.


_Software evolution_ is a specialisation in ((Software Engineering)) that address the following:

*  Understanding the reasons for software evolution.
*  Understanding the impact of software evolution on the structure and quality of source code.
*  Developing ((Software Metric))s and tools to measure the impact of software evolution.
*  Developing methods and tools for the better understanding of source code.
*  Developing ((Refactoring)) tools to counter the effects of software evolution.

First steps using Rascal

.Description

You can start using Rascal by following these steps:

* *Download and Install* Rascal by carefully following the instructions at the [Rascal Website](http://www.rascal-mpl.org/start/).

CAUTION: Please respect the recommended versions of Java (JDK) and Eclipse (Eclipse for RCP Developers).
In case of installation problems you can consult the [trouble shooting](http://www.rascal-mpl.org/help/troubleshooting.html) page
or [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rascal).


* *Start* Rascal. The Rascal system comes in two flavours: a command line version and a version integrated in Eclipse.


At the command line the Rascal system can be invoked by typing the command `*rascal*`. 
Next, the Rascal prompt `*rascal>*` appears and you can start typing commands (declarations, statements, expressions). 
To simplify interactive use, semicolons (`;`) that end commands may be omitted at the top level.

NOTE: `rascal` command is not yet standard installed

In the Eclipse version, Rascal modules can be edited and a command console is also available.

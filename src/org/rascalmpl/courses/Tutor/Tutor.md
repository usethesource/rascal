.Description
The RascalTutor is an interactive ((Authoring)) and learning environment intended to create and follow interactive courses related to the Rascal language.
It is based on the following principles and ideas:

* The basic notion is a ((Concept)). Each concept has a _name_ and contains a fixed set of subsections that describe it.
* A course is a _concept tree_:
  The central subject of the course is the root of the concept tree, and all subtrees further explain their parent concept.


A _student_ using a course can:

* Browse through the table of contents of the concept tree of the course.
* Search for concepts and specific terms using a search box.
* Read individual concepts.
* Follow links to other concepts.

An _author_ of a course can:

* Create a new course.
* Create a new concept in a course.
* Edit a concept directly using a standard text editor.
* Add code examples that are actually executed when the concept is turned into an HTML page.
* Recompile the course.
* Inspect the warnings that are generated for the whole course in order to 
  control the quality of the concept descriptions.

The actual markup used is an extension of _AsciiDoc_, see http://asciidoctor.org and
in most cases we directly refer to 

* http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/
* http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/

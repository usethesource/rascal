#### Description

_Elisabeth_ is a software architect at a large airplane manufacturer and her concern is reliability and dependability of 
airplane control software. She and her team have designed a UML model of the control software and have extended it with annotations that describe the reliability of individual components. 
She will use this annotated model in two ways: 

*  to extract relevant information from it to synthesize input for a statistical tool that will compute overall system reliability from the reliability of individual components;
*  to generate executable code that takes the reliability issues into account.

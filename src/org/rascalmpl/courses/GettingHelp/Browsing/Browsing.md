#### Synopsis

Browsing the Rascal documentation

#### Description

All Rascal documentation has been indexed and cross-referenced 
and can be accessed via a single browser interface. 

##### Structure

It is organized
in _courses_, each course consist of
a hierarchy of _concepts_. For example, the documentation for `while` is found in the
course named [Rascal]((Rascal))
and the complete name is [Rascal/Statements/While]((Rascal:Statements-While)).

##### Links

Courses will refer to the concepts in other courses via links. All links have
been checked before publication.

#### API docs

Every Rascal library project also represents one _course_. Each module produces
one _concept_ and encapsulates what is defined and documented within. In particular
the [standard library]((Library)) is interesting to browse. The package hierarchy
of the library is mapped one-to-one to the concept hierarchy of the corresponding course.

#### Code examples

Almost all code examples in the documentation are tested automatically before the documentation
is published. So you can freely copy/paste from the documentation.

#### Search

Most pages are indexed carefully, for example using the appropriate keywords and punctuation of Rascal. 

Nevertheless the search box on the website will produce
results in all courses, like [Help]((GettingHelp)) (this course)
and [Recipes]((Recipes)) or ((Library)). 

The order of appearance of search results is based on several heuristics.

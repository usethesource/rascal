In the right pane you find the search results,
most relevant first (this happpens to be the
description of the `while` statement).
Each result consists of a clickable link and
a synopsis of the information to be found there.

In the top left corner, you find a search box
for new searches and the RascalTutor logo image:/images/rascal-tutor-small.png[width="40",heigth="40"] that
will bring you back to the Tutor home page.

All Rascal documentation is organized

a hierarchy of _concepts_.
The documentation for `while` is found in the
course named [Rascal]((Rascal))
and the complete name is [Rascal/Statements/While]((Rascal:Statements-While)).

There are other courses like [Help]((Help)) (this course)
and [Recipes]((Recipes)) and the search for while

`while` quite a lot).

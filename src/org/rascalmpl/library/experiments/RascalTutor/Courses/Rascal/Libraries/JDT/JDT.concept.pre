The result is a Resource (see \<a href=\"/show?concept=Resources\"\>Resources\</a\>) that is annotated with all kinds of interesting information about that specific Resource, \n   and usually also about Resources that are contained inside that resource. \n   The project/file annotation declarations are shown above.\n\</li\>\n\<li\> Next, specific facts about the Java source code can be retrieved from the annotations.    These annotations all represent values of type \<code\>BindingRel\</code\>, \<code\>EntityRel\</code\> or \<code\>ModifierRel\</code\> that are summarized above.\n   A \<code\>BindingRel\</code\> is always used to map a source code location to a fully qualified Entity label of that part of the source code. \n   \<code\>EntityRel\</code\> is simply a short hand for any kind of relation between entities.\n\</li\>\n\</ul\> This information can be extracted by various functions defined in this module.\n"," Here is an example function that extracts the sub-type relation from a given project:\n  \<pre class=\"listing\"\>EntityRel getSubTypeInformation(loc project){\n  fm = extractProject(project);\n  return fm@extends + fm@implements + \n         {class(\"Object\") x top(fm@extends + fm@implements);\n}\n\</pre\>",""," This module is only available in the Eclipse version of Rascal.\n",[])

<h1>Change Log</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Version 4.0</h1>
<ul>
<li>
added pattlet slides that are referenced from javadoc.
<li>
restricted visibility of the classes provided by org.jhotdraw.standard.
<li>
generalized the start and end points of PolyLineFigures to a LineDecoration.
<b>Note:</b>this breaks the loading of pre 4.0 drawings.
<li>
LineFigures are now implemented based on PolyLineFigures
<li>
some UI tweaks related to the look of handles.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Version 4.0a</h1>
<ul>
<li>
javadoc documentation.
<li>
features
<ul>
<li>
support for cursor keys to move figures
<li>
support for snap to grid: ToggleGridCommand, DrawingView.setGrid();
<li>
alignment commands to align (top, centers, bottoms, left, middle, rights)
AlignmentCommand
<li>
resizable ImageFigures. The ImageFigures use the IconKit to share images.
Images are currently stored by saving a reference to their
image file. The file names are relative to the user.dir
property.
</ul>
<li>
org.jhotdraw.util.Geom: geometrical utilities.
<li>
class RectLocators: useful locators for rectangle locations.<br>
class RectTrackers: useful trackers to manipulate rectangle locations.
<li>
Major rewrite of Connections.
<ul>
<li>
connectivity support is implemented based on an ObserverFigure
interface.
<li>
ConnectionTool supports the creation and manipulation of
connections (splitting/joining segments). ConnectionTool
takes a prototype of the connection to be created.
<li>
eliminated AnchorFigure. Its only purpose was to add
ConnectionHandles.
<li>
Connection support moved from the standard to the framework package
<li>
ConnectionTrackHandle changed to ChangeConnectionStartHandle and
ChangeConnectionEndHandle. These two handles enable to change
the start/end point of a connection.
<li>
ConnectionHandle takes the prototype of the connection to be
created as parameter.
<li>
ConnectionFigure.canConnect(Figure source, Figure target)
to constrain the connection between figures.
See the PertDependency for an example for how to use this.
<li>
fixed naming inconsistencies in all signatures.
<ul>
<li>
anchor was changed to start
<li>
target was changed to end
</ul>
<li>
eliminated Figure.connectionStartPoint, connectionEndPoint
the new connection infrastructure made them obsolete.
</ul>
<li>
Figure is now an interface and no longer an abstract class.
AbstractFigure provides default implementations for the
Figure interface. If you defined your own figures you have to change the base class
from Figure to AbstractFigure.
<li>
eliminated: org.jhotdraw.applet.AppletIconKit and
org.jhotdraw.application.StandaloneIconKit
The functionality of these subclasses is now part of
the DrawingEditor interface
<li>
IconKit
<ul>
<li>
simplified the addition of new custom icons for tool buttons
<li>
Applet and Applications load their icons
by overriding registerPreLoadedImages (see PertApplet).
<li>
Icons are now identified by their file name without the
.gif suffix.
<li>
Example:
<pre>
     kit.registerImages(tracker, kit.icon("TEXT"));
</pre>
<li>
extended to support the deferred loading of images and to share images.
</ul>
<li>
added FigureContainer.forceUpdate() such that a figure
can force a repair of its image immediatly.
<li>
added transient variable modifier were appropriate
<li>
DrawingView: added support for additional background and
foreground layers. A layer implements the Painter interface.
<li>
Replaced ScribbleFigure with a more general PolyLineFigure. A PolyLineFigure
has an optional LineDecoration at its start and end.
<li>
packaging
<ul>
<li>
moved Animatable from standard to util
<li>
moved BouncingDrawing, Animator, AnimationDecorator from standard to
javadraw
<li>
changed Transformer to Tracker and Transformer.transform() to Tracker.track()
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Version 3.8</h1>
<ul>
<li>
added Drawing.orphan() to fix grouping bugs related to connectivity
<li>
added Drawing.replace().
<li>
added FigureDeletedEvent, FigureChangedEvent. Deliver more
specific update notifications.
</ul>

<h2>Version 3.6</h1>
<ul>
<li>
add Figure.decompose(), Figure.isMoveable() (to fix connection and grouping bugs)
<li>
Figure subclasses now have to implement basicDisplayBox instead of
  displayBox. DisplayBox is a template method that factors the
  common displaybox logic.
<li>
applet package: provides base infrastructure for applets
  Common applets now derive from JavaDrawApplet
<li>
application package: provides base infrastructure for applications
  Common applications now derive from JavaDrawApplet
</ul>

<h2>Version 3.4</h1>
<ul>
<li>
make reverse iterator package private
<li>
introduced an Animatable interface
  remove animation methods out of basic Drawing
<li>
GroupFigure propagate setAttribute to figures
<li>
make locators, transformers sharable, don't have to override constructors
<li>
CommandMenu return false if not handled by a command
<li>
Merged DrawWindow & Draw
<li>
Figure.handles() is now an abstract method
<li>
nuked the HandleKit stuff
<li>
Name Changes
<ul>
<li>DrawApplet -> Draw
<li>package framework -> fw
<li>DrawingReader/DrawingWriter -> Reader/Writer
<li>DrawWindow -> Draw
<li>cloneFigure -> clone
<li>readWith/writeWith -> read/write
</ul>
<li>
New
<ul>
<li>PertFigure
<li>Selectiontools support selections with a rubberband
<li>DuplicateCommand
<li>FigureAttributes class
</ul>
</ul>

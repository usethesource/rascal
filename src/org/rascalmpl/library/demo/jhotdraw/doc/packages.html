<h2><a href=../javadoc/Package-org.jhotdraw.framework.html>org.jhotdraw.framework</a></h2>

JHotDraw framework. It doesn't provide any concrete implementation classes.

<h2><a href=../javadoc/Package-org.jhotdraw.standard.html>org.jhotdraw.standard</a></h2>
The standard package provides standard implementations of the classes
defined in the framework package.
<p>
It provides abstract classes that implement a
framework interface and provide default implementation. The convention is to
prefix such classes with Abstract, e.g., AbstractFigure, AbstractHandle.

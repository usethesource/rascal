<h1>JHotDraw 5.4</h1>

<hr><p>   
<b>Preface: This is a beta release [JHotDraw5.4b1]<p>
This beta release contains the latest CVS snapshot and should be considered as progress
in work. It has not been extensively tested but is aimed to give developers access to a
more recent version of JHotDraw that 5.3.<p>
The release includes numereous new features among them: undo/redo support, enhanced MDI support,
many new figures (TextArea and figures with HTML support), zooming, minimap preview,
bug fixes,...<p>
Moreover, it contains a skeleton test suite which has been generated using JUnitDoclet.
The tests are compilable but not functional. Anyway, the excuse for not writing tests
because there weren't any is now not valid anymore ;-) Anyone contributing tests and filling the
test suite with life is welcome!<p>
Finally, developers who require a more stable release or are not willing to bear with some
bugs and exceptions should not use this beta release. Anyone else gets a preview of
the new functionality and compatibility. Any comments are welcome but (timely) response
cannot be guaranteed.

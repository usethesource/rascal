@synopsis{Infer ((TextEdit)) from the differences between two parse ((ParseTree::Tree))s}
@description{
This module provides an essential building block for creating high-fidelity source-to-source code transformations.
It is common for industrial use cases of source-to-source transformation to extract
a list of text edits programmatically using parse tree pattern matching. This way the 
changes are made on the textual level, with less introduction of noise and fewer removals 
of valuable layout (indentation) and source code comments. 

The construction of such high-fidelity edit lists can be rather involved because it tangles
and scatters a number of concerns:
1. syntax-directed pattern matching
2. string substitution; construction of the rewritten text
   * retention of layout and in particular indentation
   * retention of source code comments
   * retention of specific case-insensitive keyword style
   * syntactic correctness of the result; especially in relation to list separators there are many corner-cases to thing of

On the other hand, ParseTree to ParseTree rewrites are much easier to write and get correct. 
They are "syntax directed" via the shape of the tree that follows the grammar of the language.
Some if not all of the above aspects are tackled by the rewriting mechanism with concrete patterns.
Especially the corner cases w.r.t. list separators are all handled by the rewriting mechanisms.
Also the rules are in "concrete syntax", on both the matching and the substition side. So they are 
readable for all who know the object language. The rules guarantee syntactic correctness of the 
rewritten source code. However, rewrite rules do quite some noisy damage to the layout, indentation 
and comments, of the result.

With this module we bring these two modalities of source-to-source transformations together:
1. The language engineer uses concrete syntax rewrite rules to derive a new ParseTree from the original;
2. We run ((treeDiff)) to obtain a set of minimal text edits;
3. We apply the text edits to the editor contents or the file system.
}
@benefits{
* Because the derived text edits change fewer characters, the end result is more "hifi" than simply
unparsing the rewritten ParseTree. More comments are retained and more indentation is kept the same. More
case-insensitive keywords retain their original shape.
* At the same time the rewrite rules are easier to maintain as they remain "syntax directed". 
* Changes to the grammar will be picked up when checking all source and target patterns. 
* The diff algorithm uses cross-cutting information from the parse tree (what is layout and what not,
 what is case-insensitive, etc.) which would otherwise have to be managed by the language engineer in _every rewrite rule_.
* The diff algoritm understands what indentation is and brings new sub-trees to the original level
of indentation (same as the sub-trees they are replacing)
* Typically the algorithm's run-time is lineair in the size of the tree, or better. Same for memory usage.
}
@pitfalls{
* ((treeDiff)) only works under the assumption that the second tree was derived from the first
by applying concrete syntax rewrite rules in Rascal. If there is no origin relation between the two
then its heuristics will not work. The algorithm could degenerate to substituting the entire file,
or worse it could degenerate to an exponential search for commonalities in long lists. 
* ((treeDiff))'s efficiency is predicated on the two trees being derived from each other in main memory of the currently running JVM.
This way both trees will share pointers where they are the same, which leads to very efficient equality
testing. If the trees are first independently serialized to disk and then deserialized again, and then ((treeDiff)) is called, 
this optimization is not present and the algorithm will perform (very) poorly.
* Substitution patterns should be formatted as best as possible. The algorithm will not infer
spacing or relative indentation inside of the substituted subtree. It will only infer indentation
for the entire subtree. Another way of resolving this is using a code formatter on the subsituted patterns.

@synopsis{Detects minimal differences between parse trees and makes them explicit as ((TextEdit)) instructions.}
@description{
This is a "diff" algorithm of two parse trees to generate a ((TextEdit)) script that applies the differences on 
the textual level, _with minimal collatoral damage in whitespace_. This is why it is called "HiFi": minimal unnecessary
noise introduction to the original file.

The resulting ((TextEdit))s are an intermediate representation for making changes in source code text files. 
They can be executed independently via ((ExecuteTextEdits)), or interactively via ((IDEServices)), or LanguageServer features. 

This top-down diff algorithm takes two arguments:
1. an _original_ parse tree for a text file, 
2. and a _derived_ parse tree that is mostly equal to the original but has pieces of it substituted or rewritten. 

From the tree node differences between these two trees, ((TextEdit))s are derived such that:
* when the edited source text is parsed again, the resulting tree would match the derived tree. 
However, the parsed tree could be different from the derived tree in terms of whitespace, indentation and case-insensitive literals (see below).
* when tree nodes (grammar rules) are equal, smaller edits are searched by pair-wise comparison of the children
* differences between respective layout or (case insensitve) literal nodes are always ignored 
* when lists have changed, careful editing of possible separators ensures syntactic correctness
* when new sub-trees are inserted, the replacement will be at the same indentation level as the original. 
* when case-insensitive literals have been changed under a grammar rule that remained the same, no edits are produced.

The function comes in handy when we use Rascal to rewrite parse trees, and then need to communicate the effect
back to the IDE (for example using ((util::IDEServices)) or ((util::LanguageServer)) interfaces). We use
((ExecuteTextEdits)) to _test_ the effect of ((TextEdits)) while developing a source-to-source transformation. 
}
@benefits{
* This function allows the language engineer to work in terms of abstract and concrete syntax trees while manipulating source text. The
((TextEdit))s intermediate representation bridge the gap to the minute details of IDE interaction such as "undo" and "preview" features.
* Text editing is fraught with details of whitespace, comments, list separators; all of which are handled here by 
the exactness of syntactic and semantic knowledge of the parse trees. 
* Where possible the algorithm also retains the capitalization of case-insensitive literals.
* The algorithm retrieves and retains indentation levels from the original tree, even if sub-trees in the
derived tree have mangled indentation. This allows us to ignore the indentation concern while thinking of rewrite
rules for source-to-souce transformation, and focus on the semantic effect. 
}
@pitfalls{
* If the first argument is not an original parse tree, then basic assumptions of the algorithm fail and it may produce erroneous text edits.
* If the second argument is not derived from the original, then the algorithm will produce a single text edit to replace the entire source text.
* If the second argument was not produced from the first in the same JVM memory, it will not share many pointers to equal sub-trees
and the performance of the algorithm will degenerate quickly.
* If the parse tree of the original does not reflect the current state of the text in the file, then the generated text edits will do harm. 
* If the original tree is not annotated with source locations, the algorithm fails.
* Both parse trees must be type correct, e.g. the number of symbols in a production rule, must be equal to the number of elements of the argument list of ((Tree::appl)).
* This algorithm does not work with ambiguous (sub)trees.

If we rewrite parse trees, this can be done with concrete syntax matching.
The following example swaps the if-branch with the else-branch in Pico:

    '       a : natural,
    '       b : natural;
    '   if a then 
    '       a := b
    '   else
    '       b := a
    '   fi
    'end");
original = parse(#start[Program], |tmp://example.pico|);
// match and replace all conditionals
rewritten = visit(original) {

@description{
This algorithm uses heuristics to avoid searching for the largest common sublist all too often.
Also it minimized the sublists that largest common sublist is executed on. 

1. Since many patches to parse tree lists typically only change a prefix or a postfix, and we 
can detect this quickly, we first extract patches for those instances.
2. It is also fast and easy to detect unchanged prefixes and postfixes, so by focusing
on the changes parts in the middle we generate more instances of case 1.
3. Another simple and quick case is when simply all elements are different (the prefix==the list==the postfix)
3. What we are left with is either an empty list and we are done, or a more complex situation
where we apply the "largestEqualSubList" algorithm, which splits the list in three parts:
   * two unequal prefixes
   * two equal sublists in the middle
   * two unequal postfixes
4. the algorithm then concatenates the diffs by recursing to step 1 on the prefixes and the diffs by recursing to step 1. on the postfixes 
5. two empty lists terminate the recursion,

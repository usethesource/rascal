@synopsis{a symbolic representation for abstract syntax trees of programming languages.}
@description{
We provide a general set of data types for the syntactic constructs of programming languages: `Expression`, `Statement`, `Declaration` and `Type`.
Also, very common syntactic constructs are added to this, such as `if`, `while`, etc.

The idea is that parsers for different languages will map to common abstract syntax elements, when this can be done meaningfully.
If not, then these front-ends will extend the existing types with new constructor definitions, or even new kinds of types will
be added. The shared representation limits the element of surprise when working with different languages, and perhaps may
make some downstream analyses reusable.

The concept of a source location is important for abstract syntax trees. The annotation `src` will always point to value of type `loc`, pointing to the physical location of the construct in the source code.

The concept of _declaration_ is also relevant. A `decl` annotation points from a use of a concept to its definition, but always via an indirection (i.e. fully qualified name). The `decl` annotation is also of type `loc`, where each location is a fully qualified name of the definition that is used. 

Finally, the concept of a _type_ is relevant for ASTs. In particular an `Expression` may have a `typ` annotation, or a variable declaration, etc.

@benefits{
* Symbolic abstract syntax trees can be analyzed and transformed easily using Rascal primitives such as patterns, comprehensions and visit.
* By re-using recognizable names for different programming languages, it's easier to switch between languages to analyze.
* Some algorithms made be reusable on different programming languages, but please be aware of the _pitfalls_.
}
@pitfalls{
*  Even though different languages may map to the same syntactic construct, this does not mean that the semantics is the same. Downstream
metrics or other analysis tools should still take semantic differences between programming languages into account.

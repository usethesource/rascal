@synopsis{Start a new external process.}
@description{
The file schemes that are allowed for the `processCommand` are limited to the `file:///` schemes
and all logical schemes that directly resolve to `file:///` such as `cwd:///` and `tmp:///`.
`PATH:///` is also a handy scheme for `processCommand` since it searches for the binary/script
in the underlying system's search path.

The arguments to `args` given are all converted to strings before passing them into the command.
Special treatment is given to `loc` arguments, which are first resolved to `file:///` schemes and
then printed to OS-specific absolute path names.

For environment variables in `envVars` the same treatment is given to convert values to strings.
